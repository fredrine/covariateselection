Evaluation of forward selection procedures for selecting covariates to include in a GLM describing neuronal tuning, used in Nevjen, F. and Dunn, B. (2023) Towards robust statistical methods for the neural coding problem with autocorrelated and missing variables.

Methods are tested on the calcium data used by Zong W, Obenhaus HA, Skytøen ER, Eneqvist H, de Jong NL, Vale R, Jorge MR, Moser MB, Moser EI. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging in freely moving mice. Cell. 2022; 185(7):1240–1256, and on simulated data.
